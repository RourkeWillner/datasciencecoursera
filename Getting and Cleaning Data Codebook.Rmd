The data presented here is an amalgam of datasets from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset,"
created by Smartlab Non-Linear Complex Systems Laboratory.  For more information on the original datasets and the 
transformations to the original datasets, please consult the README.md file, and the run_analysis.R script.
