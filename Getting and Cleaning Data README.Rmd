Background
---

The run_analysis.R script operates on text files of data gathered by the Smartlab Non-Linear Complex Systems Laboratory.
The original dataset contained sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope), recorded from 30 volunteers performing six
different activities.

The run_analysis.R script combines the component parts of the aformentioned dataset, and extracts only the measurements 
on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (this is taken to mean measurements that include "-mean()" or 
"-std()" in their title).  This dataset is then saved as a tab-delimited text file called "DataSet1.txt," in the working
directory.

The run_analysis.R script then creates a second dataset, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
for each activity and each subject. This dataset is then printed to the console, and saved as a tab-delimited text file 
called "DataSet2.txt," in the working directory.

An explanation of the measurement names can be found in "Getting and Cleaning Data Codebook.md"

Running the run_analysis.R Script
---

- Ensure the following files are in the working directory:
  - 'features.txt'
  - 'activity_labels.txt'
  - 'X_train.txt'
  - 'y_train.txt'
  - 'subject_train.txt'
  - 'X_test.txt'
  - 'y_test.txt'
  - 'subject_test.txt'

The Output
---

The output of the run_analysis.R script is two tab-delimited text files.  These can be opened in a text editor or Microsoft
Excel, among other programs.  Depending on which text editor is used, the data may not appear in straight columns.

In order to read the file into an R editor, put the file in R's working directory and enter:

read.table("filename.txt", header=TRUE)
